# HTTP Interface demo

This project is a demo project that shows how to use the newly added Spring Framework [HTTP Interface](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.0.0-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/integration.html#rest-http-interface) with Spring Boot.

The HTTP Interface allows the defintion of HTTP services as a Java interface with annotated methods for HTTP exchanges.

With the interface defined, you can generate a proxy that implements this interface and performs the exchanges.
